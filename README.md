## Project Overview

The **Student Result Management System (SRMS)** is a dynamic and efficient Desktop/web-based platform tailored to streamline the academic record management processes for educational institutions. By automating key workflows such as student registration, course management, and result processing, the SRMS ensures accuracy, reliability, and ease of use.

### Key Objectives:

- **Simplify academic administration** by centralizing student and course records.
- **Provide scalability** to accommodate diverse academic structures.
- **Enhance transparency** for students and faculty through intuitive interfaces.

- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - Bootstrap 5.3.3 (for responsive UI design)
  - jQuery 3.6.0 (for enhanced interactivity)
  - DataTables (for managing tabular data effectively)

---

## Features

### 1. User Authentication
- Role-based access control for **Administrators** and **Students**.
- Secure login system with **password hashing** using `password_hash()`.
- Session-based user management with **CSRF protection**.

### 2. Student Management
- Add, update, or delete student profiles.
- Advanced search and filtering options for quick access to records.
- Student profile management with support for academic tracking.

### 3. Course Management
- Department-wise organization of courses.
- Support for dynamic course grading schemes.
- Semester-based course assignment and registration.

### 4. Result Processing
- Manual or bulk entry of examination results.
- Automated calculation of GPA and CGPA.
- Comprehensive result validation and verification processes.
- Grade breakdown with customizable grading policies.

### 5. Academic Structure
- Supports **semester-based sessions** and **multiple academic years**.
- Organized department and class-level hierarchy (e.g., ND1, ND2, HND1, HND2).

## System Architecture

The SRMS is built on a **modular architecture** that emphasizes scalability, security, and maintainability:

```plaintext
┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│ Presentation   │     │ Business      │     │ Data          │
│ Layer (UI)     │ ◄───│ Logic Layer   │ ◄───│ Access Layer  │
│ (HTML/JS/PHP)  │     │ (PHP Classes) │     │ (MySQL)       │
└───────────────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────────────┘
```

---

## Database Design

### Core Tables:
- **`students`**: Contains personal and academic details of students.
- **`courses`**: Manages course details and relationships.
- **`results`**: Records scores and grades for each student.
- **`departments`**: Organizes academic departments and their courses.
- **`academic_years`**: Tracks academic sessions.
- **`grades`**: Stores grading scales and GPA calculation rules.

### Key Relationships:
- `students` ↔ `courses`: Many-to-many (via course registration).
- `students` ↔ `results`: One-to-many.
- `departments` ↔ `courses`: One-to-many.

## Grading System

### Grading Policy:
| Grade | Range (%) | Grade Point |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| A     | 70-100    | 4.0         |
| B     | 60-69     | 3.0         |
| C     | 50-59     | 2.0         |
| D     | 45-49     | 1.0         |
| E     | 40-44     | 0.0         |
| F     | 0-39      | 0.0         |

### GPA Calculation Formula:
```math
GPA = Σ(Course Credit × Grade Point) / Total Credits
```

### Classification:
| Classification   | GPA Range |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Distinction       | 3.50-4.00 |
| Upper Credit      | 3.00-3.49 |
| Lower Credit      | 2.50-2.99 |
| Pass              | 2.00-2.49 |
| Fail              | < 2.00    |
